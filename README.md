# Harry Gitter

You feel powerful using Git, don't you? 

So, why don't you use spells instead of commands?

## Install
For bash or zsh:
```
./install.sh
```

or, if you just want to try it:

```
source harry_gitter.sh
```

## Usage
![usage](/img/usage.gif "Usage")


## Uninstall
```
./uninstall.sh
```

## Changes
PR's are welcome! If you want to add spells or just improve the installation script, send me a pull request, I'll appreciate!

## Disclaimer
This is a funny project, although it should work properly, I do not recommend a professional usage. 

I'm not responsible in case you'll get fired or your repo will explode.
